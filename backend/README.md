# ETHernal Reviews
Dapps rating platform. Only users that interacted with a certain Dapp can rate it. User logs in with an ETH address. Users can evaluate a project only if there is an activity at his address with relevant contract addresses.
This should guarantee that just real users rate Dapps.

## Current state
- ENS protocol reviews.
- Centralised database of reviews.
- Log in with Ethereum address.

## Next steps
- Another Dapps implemented (Aave, Uniswap...).
- Reviews are stored on the Optimism as an NFTs - with the text of the review on IPFS. Every review is minted to the user address so no one can ever hide them.
- Log in with Polygon ID.
